# CPR*: Formally Verified Compact Position Reporting Algorithm 

The Compact Position Reporting (CPR) algorithm consists of a set of functions defined in the standard RTCA-DO- 260B/Eurocae ED-102A, Minimum Operational Performance Standards for 1090 MHz extended squitter Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS- B) and Traffic Information Services - Broadcast (TIS-B). These function encode and decode aircraft positions. CPR* is a formally verified C implementation of CPR's functions that use computer arithmetic in fixed- and floating-point formats.

## The Fixed-Point Implementation

The directory [`C/fixed-point`](C/fixed-point) contains a fixed-point C implementation of the CPR functions.
The [ACSL](https://frama-c.com/acsl.html) specification language was used to state correctness properties for the core components of this implementation.
Such correctness properties assure that each C function behaves accordingly with a logical description of it written also in ACSL.
The [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/index.html) static analyzer was then used to process these annotated C functions and output verification conditions (VCs) expressed in [PVS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com/) language.
The directory `PVS` contains the resulting VCs and proofs for them.
Additionally, proofs of the correctness of the logical descriptions w.r.t. the aforementioned standard (under the modified set of requirements presented in [1]) can also be found in the same directory.

## The Floating-Point Implementation

The floating-point C implementation can be found in the directory [`C/floating-point`](C/floating-point).
As in the previous case, ACSL annotations along the code are used to relate the result of each core function with the result of its real valued specification.
Since in this case the implementation was developed using floating-point operations, the annotations take into consideration the maximum possible roundoff error occurred in the calculations performed on each operation. 
In order to deal with this kind of VCs, the Frama-C analyzer was used to generate [Gappa](http://gappa.gforge.inria.fr/) representations of them.
These Gappa specifications were manually modified to add hints allowing the Gappa solver to automatically discharge the VCs.
The modified Gappa files can be found in the [`Gappa`](Gappa) directory.
Finally, PVS was used to prove that the real valued specifications of the core functions are correct w.r.t. the standard assuming the set of corrected requirements reported in [1]. 
The [`PVS`](PVS) directory contains these proofs.
For details on the verification process for the floating-point implementation, see [2].
